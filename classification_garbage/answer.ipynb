    "- **Data**\n",
    "  - We have 2 classes: `clean` and `dirty`\n",
    "  - FOR EACH of them, we have the following splits:\n",
    "    -  `train`:\n",
    "       -  20 labelled samples\n",
    "       -  280 unlabelled samples\n",
    "    -  `test`: 100 unlabelled samples, we labelled them\n",
    "   -  The 280 unlabelled samples were all labelled and exploited this way:\n",
    "      -  20 samples were picked for the validation set to asses the model's performance during training\n",
    "      -  The rest (260) constituted a sort of inference test to simulate a real-world deployment with feedback (since we have the real labels)\n",
    "   -  As previously said, some images were very hard to classify visually, this work assumes we have correctly identified the labels\n",
    "   -  For reproducibility, the classified images file names are saved in text files: `train|val|test|inference/clean|dirty.txt`\n",
    "-  **Model**\n",
    "   - We are going to train a YOLO model (v11) from [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) on a classification task\n",
    "   - It achieves state-of-the-art performance accros multiple tasks\n",
    "   - Generally, the images don't need any prior manual processing\n",
    " - **Evaluation**\n",
    "   - We expect to achieve a high score on the binary classification metrics (accuracy, precision, and recall)\n",
    "   - In this use case, we assume that a \"dirty\" prediction on an image will alert a garbage collector to remove the dirt\n",
    "   - Therefore, we think it's more suitable to trigger some false alarms (\"clean\" garbage predicted as \"dirty\"), than missing a really full garbage can (\"dirty\" classified as \"clean\")"
